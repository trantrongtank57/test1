ACL injuries are among the most common sports-related injuries, and ACL reconstruction is one of the most performed orthopedic procedures globally. However, no two cases are alike. This dataset doesn't offer individual medical advice but rather aggregates valuable trends and insights across hundreds or thousands of patients.

We hope that by presenting this data clearly, we empower better decision-making for patients, clinicians, and researchers alike.

If you are a patient considering ACL reconstruction, please consult your orthopedic surgeon for advice tailored to your unique condition.
